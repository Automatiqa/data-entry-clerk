> Hello, I'm your friendly _data entry clerk_. I take whatever data you give me
and store them in your database for later processing.

**Data Entry Clerk** might be a little demeaning, but it describes the purpose
of this project perfectly: To be able to analyse data, you need to have data.
The DEC stores whatever data you give it in a database for later processing.

Most external services allow data to be shared via [webhooks][webhook]. The DEC
provides an endpoint that accepts such webhooks and stores their payload in a
database.

While the application is set up in a way that allows different deployments
(e.g. via Docker), the initial implementation is made with [AWS Lambda][lambda]
and [DynamoDB] in mind.

## Development

To extend the service or customize it, either fork or clone this repository.

### Installation

We recommend that you create a [virtual environment](virtualenv) to isolate the
Python interpreter and all dependencies from your system Python or any other
projects you're working on.

```bash
virtualenv --python=$(which python3) .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then, install DEC's dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that, you can hack away and make any changes you require to make the code
work for you. ðŸ˜Š

### DynamoDB

The default backend for DEC is Amazon's [DynamoDB]. For development and
testing, you can run an instance locally. First, go to the following page and
download the package from your nearest region:

[Setting Up DynamoDB Local](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html#DynamoDBLocal.DownloadingAndRunning)

Then, extract its contents into the `dynamodb` directory. Once you've done
this, you can use the script `start_dynamodb.sh` in `scripts` to run the
server.

**Note:** When starting the database for the first time, make sure to run
`create_table.sh` in a different terminal as well.

### Running the server

During development, you can run the server by simply starting the app:

    FLASK_APP=app.py flask run
